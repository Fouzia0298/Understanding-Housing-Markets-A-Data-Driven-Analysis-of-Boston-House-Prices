## Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning models trained on the Boston Housing Dataset. The goal is to build accurate predictive models, interpret their results, and derive actionable insights into factors influencing housing prices. Custom implementations of Linear Regression and Random Forest are used, alongside feature importance analysis to identify key predictors.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Build regression models to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to employment centers.
- Use explainable AI techniques (e.g., feature importance) to interpret model predictions.
- Provide insights into factors that significantly influence housing prices.

## Dataset Description and Preprocessing Steps

### Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** Boston Housing Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)
- **Features:** The dataset contains various attributes describing neighborhoods and houses, such as:
  - **Numerical Features:** Crime rate (`CRIM`), average number of rooms per dwelling (`RM`), percentage of lower-status population (`LSTAT`).
  - **Target Variable:** Median value of owner-occupied homes (`PRICE`).

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Checked for missing values and ensured the dataset was complete before analysis.
2. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Normalized numerical features using z-score normalization to ensure all features were on the same scale.
3. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.

## Models Implemented with Rationale

### Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression:**
   - A simple and interpretable model used as a baseline for comparison.
   - Selected to evaluate the performance of a basic linear model.
2. **Random Forest Regressor:**
   - A tree-based ensemble model capable of capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
   - Selected for its robustness and ability to rank feature importance.

### Rationale for Selection
- **Linear Regression:** Chosen as a baseline to benchmark performance and ensure simpler models are not overlooked.
- **Random Forest:** Selected for its high accuracy and ability to handle complex relationships in the data.

## Key Insights and Visualizations

### Key Insights
- **High-Impact Features:** The number of rooms (`RM`), socioeconomic status (`LSTAT`), and pupil-teacher ratio (`PTRATIO`) are the most significant predictors of house prices.
- **Trends Observed:**
  - Houses with more rooms tend to have higher prices.
  - Areas with lower socioeconomic status tend to have lower house prices.

### Visualizations
1. **Feature Importance:**
   - A bar plot highlighting the top features influencing house prices.
2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Scatter plots showing relationships between key features (e.g., `RM`, `LSTAT`) and house prices.
3. **Residual Analysis:**
   - Residual plots to evaluate model performance and identify patterns in prediction errors.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Urban Planning:**
   - Focus on improving socioeconomic conditions in low-income areas to increase property values.
2. **Education Investment:**
   - Improve pupil-teacher ratios in schools to make neighborhoods more attractive to buyers.
3. **Housing Development:**
   - Encourage the construction of larger homes with more rooms to meet market demand.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenges
1. **Non-Linearity in Data:**
   - Linear Regression struggled to capture complex relationships in the data.
   - **Solution:** Used Random Forest to model non-linear relationships effectively.
2. **Feature Interpretability:**
   - Understanding feature importance required additional tools like SHAP or custom implementations.
   - **Solution:** Built a custom feature importance function for the Random Forest model.
3. **Dataset Size:**
   - The dataset was relatively small, limiting the complexity of models that could be trained.
   - **Solution:** Used simpler models and focused on interpretability.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: Model training and evaluation.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.
